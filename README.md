APCSProject
===========

##APCS first term final project

####Premise of project:
 A name generator (can be used for picking baby names) based on criteria such as:
    - gender (primarily male, primarily female, or can be both)
    - how masculine/feminine it is
    - how modern/old-fashioned it is
    - whether it appears in the Bible(Old and New Testaments)/Torah/Quran or not
    - popularity
    - country of origin
    - how normal the name is (different from popularity--this is like how unusual the name is)
    - more things probably 

  We will use Processing or GUI to create a window where the user can enter their preferences (drop-down list for country of origin, radio buttons/checkboxes for Bible/etc, sliding scale or radio buttons for 1-10 of things like popularity, etc). The user will click "Submit" and a list of the top 5 names will come up that match their criteria. The names (and their values for each input) will be stored in a csv file. 

  We might also add an option for the user to input their own names (and the values for each input) to the csv file (this way they can add their own name, etc).
